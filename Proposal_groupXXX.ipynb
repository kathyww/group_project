    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Nervous System (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord. It serves as the main processing center for the entire body, playing a part in most biological functions. It regulates conscious thought, as well as unconscious processes such as heart rate, breathing and blood pressure.[^1] \n",
    "\n",
    "CNS tumors describe an abnormal growth or mass of cells in the brain or spinal cord. They develop when the DNA in some cells change, giving harmful instructions to divide, leading to a buildup. These tumors can be classified as malignant–or harmful, and benign–or harmless.[^2] \n",
    "\n",
    "Brain and spinal cord cancer represents a significant public health concern, accounting for nearly 18,760 deaths in 2023.[^3] While only the 16th most common form of cancer[^4], 40% of metastatic cancer transforms into brain cancer.[^5] This situation is exacerbated in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where cancer-related mortality is significantly higher–especially in people younger than 65 years of age.[^6] Early detection of cancer has shown to significantly improve survival rate, as well as drastically reduce treatment costs.[^7] However, it's estimated that 50% of cancers are detected at an advanced stage when diagnosed.[^8]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the capture of brain tumors, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) imaging has been shown to be the most effective.[^9] MRI is a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain.[^10]\n",
    "\n",
    "An earlier study conducted on MRI images done in 2008 aimed at classifying metastasis from gliomas and identifying high-grade versus low-grade gliomas achieved relatively high classification scores. The study used SVM with recursive feature elimination. [^11]\n",
    "\n",
    "A more recent study compared the performances of multiple Machine Learning models and Deep Learning models on the identification of brain tumors. The study found that CNNs–Convolutional Neural Networks was the most effective method compared to Decision Tree, Linear Discrimination, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbour, and Ensemble.[^12]\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of this dataset as MRI image data, we require to some degree a computer vision model, as well as a method of clustering extracted features. Likely candidates of our unsupervised clustering model include K-Means, DBSCAN and Spectral Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed solution involves the normalization of our image data and then the processing of our images via PCA for the purpose of feature extraction. This will likely be implemented using Sklearn. From this analysis we can then reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and pass the resulting feature vectors to an appropriate clustering/classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacent research in classifying MRI data proposes K-Means as an effective method of tumor identification (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4309506_K-means_Clustering_for_Classifying_Unlabelled_MRI_Data) from which we will draw inspiration from in our project. We will recreate this generic K-Means implementation, but will aim to improve on the \"accuracy\" by implementing other, more complex algorithms dependent on the resulting feature space of the above PCA implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of our method is in the processing of the MRI data in order to properly encapsulate our desired features for our clustering. We aim to include higher level signal processing in the proposed method of feature extraction, but due to the scope of the course, this idea will be experimented upon after our successful development of the above proposed method.
